# App Description 

The Leaderboard Tracker application that we've developed allows users to submit their score for a game, track the  scores, and compare rankings with other players. 

# Planning Process  

## Cannon washington - Front-end Development
## Aastha Mahajan - Back-end Development
## John Richardson - Database - Back-end Development


# Task Assignments

### John Richardson developed the test suite and implemented analytical tools such as Bandit, Mypy, and Flake8 to perform both static and dynamic analysis. He also enhanced the scoreboard functionality by introducing a numerical rank display for each player listed.

### Cannon Washington set-up the "Issues" in Github and used the analytical tool built into PyCharm, "Qodana" to perform static analysis. 

### Aastha Mahajan implemented the search bar feature so users can search for names on the leaderboard, added a favicon to the web app, created the Kanban board using Trello with tasks and future backlog items, and updated the README with clear instructions and updated screenshots.

3. As a developer, I want to use an API endpoint to access leaderboard data so that I can integrate it with other applications.

# Analysis tools

## Static Analysis 

Flake8 was used to check python code, programming errors, and complex constructs. 

mypy performed type-checking to ensure safety in function calls and DB interactions

## Dynamic Analysis

bandit was used to scan for security vulnerabilities in the live code.
